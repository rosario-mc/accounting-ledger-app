# Accounting Ledger CLI Application 

Hi there! I'm Rosario, and this project is really special to me — it's my **very first full Java application**. I created this Accounting Ledger as part of my Capstone 1 project for the Java Development Fundamentals course, and I’m proud to say… it will work once I am done! This README file will be continuosly updated as I keep coding!

This is a simple but powerful **Command Line Interface (CLI)** tool that keeps track of deposits and payments — perfect for personal budgeting or small business bookkeeping. It reads and writes to a `.csv` file so your data sticks with you.

## What It Will Do

From the Home Screen, you will be able to:

- **Add Deposits** – Enter the date, time, description, vendor, and amount
- **Make Payments** – Record expenses or other debits
- **View the Ledger** – See all transactions sorted by newest first
- **Generate Reports** – Quickly view Month-to-Date, Year-to-Date, or even search by vendor
- **Custom Search** – (bonus feature!) Search by date range, description, vendor, or amount (**THIS IS A CHALLENGE TASK** *I* *will* *attemp* *if* *time* *allows*)
- **Exit** – Close the program

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- CSV file for storage

Like I said earlier, I will be updating this file as I keep working along!

## What's Next?
I plan on completing my application by the EOD 5/1. In the meantime, I will build all the aspects of the aplication and improve them as I keep going!

## Final Thoughts
This project marks the start of my journey into tech, and I hope it inspires someone else just starting out, too. Thanks for checking out my work — and if you have feedback or suggestions, I’d love to hear them!
